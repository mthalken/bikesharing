# Bringing Bike-Sharing to Des Moines Iowa

## The purpose of this analysis was to look at a bike-sharing project in New York and see if bringing it to Des Moines would be a good business opportunity. 

## Project Overview:
1. Create Tableau sheets to show the following:
    - length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    - number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of the day
    - number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
    - starting and ending locations based on frequency
    - checkout times by user and gender
2. Use the Tableau sheets to create dashboards to display the graphics 
3. Use Tableau Stories to represent the story within the data

## Resources
- Source of data: [citibike.csv](https://github.com/mthalken/bikesharing/blob/main/.gitattributes)
- Software: Tableau Public 2021.4, Python 3.7.10, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2
- Please see the refactored code [here]().

## Results

    - Overall we can see that Male subscribers use the bike-sharing service the most. Also the most used times are most likely when customers and subscribers are going to or leaving work (6:00am to 10:00am and 5:00pm to 8:00pm).

    - The busiest locations are on the island of Manhattan with a few less frequently checked out in the surrounding areas.

    - Checkout times are usually less than an hour with the most checkout time being at 5 minutes with 146,752 users.

## Summary
Looking at the data represented in Tableau we can see that the majority of users are males who have purchased subscriptions with Citi-Bike and are usually around 5 minutes in trip length. While looking at whether to bring a ride sharing service to Des Moines there are a couple further analysis that should be performed; the walkability of the main downtown area vs New York, overall population/building density in Des Moines and New York, and ownership of vehicles vs parking in Des Moines and New York. Looking at how Citi-Bike marketed could be a great resource on increasing the total checkout time as well and equaling out the gender demographics. 

While bike-sharing is a great idea for the environment and health of individuals a big factor would be the usability within Des Moines itself.
